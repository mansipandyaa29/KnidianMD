"A 24-year-old woman presents with acute swelling in her right knee, pain that hinders her ability to bear weight on her right leg, and a one-week history of intermittent low-grade fevers and malaise. She has a history of daily heroin use but is otherwise healthy. She reports no recent sexual activity. On examination, her right knee is erythematous and hot, with an obvious joint effusion. She has limited and minimal range of motion of the knee. She has track marks over both antecubital fossae. Joint aspiration shows a leukocyte count of 132,000 cells per mm3 with 95% neutrophils.","{1276: 'joint swelling', 2438: 'fever', 50: 'malaise', 1469: 'Intravenous drug user', 4226: 'knee arthritis', 450: 'limited motion of range', 1320: 'Synovial fluid cell count high over 2000 ul'}"
"A 12-year-old girl presents with sudden-onset severe generalized abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. On exam she appears ill and has a temperature of 104°F (40°C). Her abdomen is tense with generalized tenderness and guarding.

"A 78-year-old man with emphysema and a 65-pack-year history of smoking reports progressive weakness during the past 3 months. The weakness is most noticeable to him upon rising from a seated position. In the past 2 months, he has lost 4.5 kg unintentionally. The patient's physical examination is largely unremarkable, with the exception of a scaly rash over the dorsum of his hands, favoring the knuckles .Laboratory results include an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 47 mm/hr (reference range, 0–17) and a creatine kinase level of 2840 U/liter (60–400).","{1225: 'Personal history of emphysema', 110: 'weakness', 160: 'weight loss', 1394: 'skin scaling',  326: 'rash', 130: 'SED rate elevated', 316: 'creatinine elevated', 3276: 'Chronic Onset'}"
"A previously healthy 15-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of sharp, left-sided, nonradiating chest pain that worsens with inspiration and lying down — and improves with sitting up and leaning forward. The patient also reports difficulty breathing and catching her breath. She recently traveled by air from San Francisco to New York and developed flulike symptoms (fever, rhinorrhea, and cough) around that time. She is up to date on her vaccines, including Covid-19 vaccination, having received her third dose 2 months ago. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is negative. Physical examination reveals a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% while the patient breathes ambient air. Her breath sounds are difficult to auscultate because her pain is causing her to take shallow breaths. She has a normal first heart sound, a split second heart sound, a 2/6 vibratory systolic murmur heard at the left midsternal border, and a rub. Her chest pain is not reproducible with palpation over costochondral junctions. She has no hepatomegaly or peripheral edema. A chest radiograph is normal. An electrocardiogram is obtained.","{3242: 'Acute Onset', 4: 'Chest pain', 1120: 'Dyspnea', 18: 'Fever', 1093: 'runny nose', 109: 'cough',  78: 'Tachycardia', 4547: 'normal bp',  1165: 'Normal respiratory rate', 1167: 'Chest x-ray normal'}"
"A 19-year-old woman reports irregular menses. She reached menarche at age 12 and has typically had a menstrual period every 60 to 70 days since then, with each one lasting approximately 5 days. It has now been 3 months since her last period. She is not sexually active and has had no galactorrhea. She feels well, exercises regularly, and does not report any recent changes in weight. Her vital signs are normal, and her BMI is 21.5. Inflammatory acne is evident on her face and back, and a few terminal hairs are evident on the thighs and on the abdominal midline below the umbilicus. The thyroid gland is not enlarged. Abdominal and external genital examinations are normal. The patient's mother developed Hashimoto thyroiditis at a young age. A urine pregnancy test is negative.","{352: 'Irregular Menses', 166: 'Oligomenorrhea', 4547: 'Bp normal', 1798: 'Acne', 184: 'Hirsutism', 3276: 'Chronic onset', 4389: 'No fever'}"

"A 59-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and stable stage 3 chronic kidney disease presents with a headache that has been gradually worsening for several months and is currently not improving despite use of acetaminophen. A review of systems is otherwise unremarkable. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 132/88 mm Hg, his heart rate is 84 beats per minute, his temperature is 36.7°C, and his oxygen saturation is 99% while he breathes ambient air. Visual-field testing shows loss of vision roughly corresponding to the outer half of vision in both eyes. Heart rhythm sounds are regular, lungs are clear, and there is trace lower-extremity edema. Extraocular movements are intact, and a neurologic examination is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory testing shows electrolytes within the normal range, a serum creatinine level of 1.74 mg/dL (0.8–1.3), an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (≥60), a hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL (13.5–17.5), and normal leukocyte and platelet counts.","{3276: 'Chronic Onset', 9: 'Personal history of Hypertension', 106: 'Personal history of Diabetes', 125: 'Headache', 4547: 'Normal BP', 4601: 'Breath sounds normal', 12: 'Edema', 2481: 'Neurological exam normal', 316: 'Serum creatinine elevated', 209: 'Glomerular filtration rate decreased', 3994: 'Hemoglobin low', 4318: 'Leukocyte normal', 4389: 'No fever', 1228: 'Oxygen saturation rate below reference range'}"
"A 68-year-old woman with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension is admitted to the intensive care unit with respiratory failure. For the past 5 days, she has been experiencing progressive shortness of breath associated with right-sided pleuritic chest pain and a cough that is occasionally productive of frothy yellow sputum streaked with blood. Today, her family brought her to the emergency department where she was noted to be markedly dyspneic with a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 81% while breathing ambient air. She was intubated immediately and admitted to the medical intensive care unit. On examination, she is sedated but opens her eyes to vigorous tactile stimulus. Her temperature is 38.3°C. Her jugular venous pulse is not visible. There are coarse crackles in both lung fields and no murmurs or gallops; there is no peripheral edema. The rest of the examination is normal. Laboratory testing yields the following results:Leukocyte count (per mm3) 15,700   4500–11,000, Hemoglobin (g/dL) 10.2 12.0–16.0, Platelet count (per mm3) 126,000    150,000–350,000, Creatinine (mg/dL) 2.5  0.6–1.1, Troponin T (ng/mL) (4th-generation assay) 0.02  0–0.03, Arterial blood gas (obtained on a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.40) pH 7.32 7.38–7.44, Partial pressure of oxygen (mm Hg) 76 80–100, Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (mm Hg) 30  35–45","{104: 'Personal history heart failure', 9: 'Personal history of Hypertension', 1120: 'Dyspnea', 4: 'Chest pain', 2591: 'Pleuritic pain', 109: 'Cough', 468: 'Productive sputum', 1887: 'Hemoptysis', 146: 'Respiratory rate elevated', 155: 'Hypoxemia', 18: 'Fever', 811: 'Rales', 33: 'Leukocytosis', 3994: 'Low Hemoglobin', 2146: 'Low platelet count', 316: 'Creatinine increased', 4211: 'Carbon dioxide low'}"
