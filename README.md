## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The problem I'm working on is analysing medical history text and extracting relevant symptoms from the database.

The input text data is medical hostory and the symptom database and the output is extracted symptoms.

## 📊 Dataset Overview <a name="data-overview"></a>

There are two input datafiles in the data directory:

test_cases.csv -> <a href="https://github.com/mansipandyaa29/KnidianMD/blob/main/data/test_cases.csv">test_cases.csv</a> 
symptoms_db.csv -> <a href="https://github.com/mansipandyaa29/KnidianMD/blob/main/data/symptoms_db.csv">symptoms_db.csv</a> 

## 🧠 Model Building <a name="machine-learning-model">

I have experimented with three Models:

1) Traditional Model -> This Model uses basic word search and word similarity
2) Traditional Embedding Model -> This Model uses basic word search, embeddings and sentence similarity.
3) RAG Pipeline
4) RAG V2: An advanced iteration of the RAG framework.
5) MedCAT
